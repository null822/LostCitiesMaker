# LostCitiesMaker
Makes mods/datapacks for modifying Lost Cities cities.
(eventually)

Current state: renders Lost Cities parts *mostly* correctly

NOTE: Requires minecraft assets (in assets.zip) and Lost Cities data (in data.zip) to be present in the run directory.
The program will crash otherwise.
